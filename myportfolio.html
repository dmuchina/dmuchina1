                <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>David is a jovial happy boy, I love exploring new things in life, am glad to create my first html assignment page.
I have a background in computer Studies, I did my first web coding in the year 2005 then disappeared.
<h2>Work Experience</h2>
I have worked in Safaricom for the last eleven years. I decided to take software engineering course
Just to update myself with the latest coding trends.
<h2>My interests</h2>
<br>
My current interest is to learn something new that will help my mind juggle technologically
And soon am seeing myself cresting web page applications, 
I love watching documentaries, am also a football fan.</p>
